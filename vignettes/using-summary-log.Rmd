# Introduction

This vignette demonstrates how to use `summary_log()` to extract model diagnostics like the objective function value, condition number, and parameter counts. 

If you are new to `rbabylon`, the ["Getting Started with rbabylon"](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/rbabylon/articles/getting-started.html) vignette will take you through some basic scenarios for modeling with NONMEM using `rbabylon`, introducing you to its standard workflow and functionality.

There is a lot of information in the `bbi_summary_log_df` tibble that is output from `summary_log()`. However, it is important to note that all of this, and quite a bit more, is contained in the `bbi_nonmem_summary` object output from `model_summary()`. If you are trying to dig deep into the outputs of a small number of models, see the [Summarize section](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/rbabylon/articles/getting-started.html#summarize-model) of the "Getting Started" vignette for an introduction to that functionality. 

`summary_log()` is more useful for getting a slightly higher-level view of a larger batch of models; potentially all the models in a given project, or something like a large group of bootstrapped runs.

## Setup

There is some initial set up necessary for using `rbabylon`. Please refer to the ["Getting Started"](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/rbabylon/articles/getting-started.html#setup) vignette, mentioned above, if you have not done this yet. Once this is done, load the library.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# NOTE: if running chunks interactively we need to load the package first
#   because renv isolation prevents us from finding an rbabylon installation
if (interactive()) {
  devtools::load_all()
}
```
```{r load packages, results = 'hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(rbabylon)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyselect)
```

```{r configure bbi, include = FALSE}
# set babylon execution path
if (Sys.which("bbi") == "") {
  options('rbabylon.bbi_exe_path' = read_bbi_path())
}
```

# What's in a Model Summary?

As mentioned above, the `bbi_summary_log_df` tibble contains a lot of information, which is a subset of what is contained in the `bbi_nonmem_summary` object returned from `model_summary()`.

```{r model summary single}
MODEL_DIR <- system.file("model/nonmem/complex",   package = "rbabylon")

sum1 <- 
  read_model(file.path(MODEL_DIR, "iovmm")) %>%
  model_summary()

names(sum1)
```

For example, the `run_details` section alone contains wealth of information about this model run:

```{r run details single}
str(sum1$run_details)
```

Much of this is very useful, but it's also a bit intimidating, and it can take some work to unpack it all and find the bits and pieces you're looking for.

# What's in the Summary Log?

The `summary_log()` function is designed to extract some of the most relevant diagnostics and model outputs from a batch of model summaries and organize them into a more easily digestible tibble. Like `run_log()` and `config_log()`, it takes two arguments:

* `.base_dir` -- Directory to look for models in.
* `.recurse` -- Logical indicating whether to search recursively in subdirectories. This is `TRUE` by default.

```{r fake summary_log for names}
sum_df <- summary_log(MODEL_DIR)
names(sum_df)
```

```{r real summary_log, include = FALSE}
# we're using test data that requires a fail flag, but this is not the focus of this vignette so we hide it.
sum_df <- summary_log(MODEL_DIR, .fail_flags = list(ext_file = "1001.1.TXT"))
```

The specific columns returned are described below, though there is also a list of them, with brief definitions, in the [`summary_log()` docs](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/rbabylon/reference/summary_log.html) that can be accessed any time with `?summary_log()` in the console.

## Housekeeping Columns

The first column is `absolute_model_path` which contains an absolute path that unambiguously identifies each model. This serves as the primary key for the tibble. The second column is simply the `basename` of this path, which is just a convenience for printing and viewing.

The third column contains the `bbi_nonmem_summary` object, discussed above, for each model. This can be extracted and manipulated if you would like more detailed data from it.

The `error_msg` and `needed_fail_flags` columns describe whether `bbi` had any trouble parsing the model outputs. These won't be discussed in detail here. Refer to the [`summary_log()` docs](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/rbabylon/reference/summary_log.html) for more information.

## Run Details Columns

The next batch of columns contain the core diagnostics and model outputs. As mentioned above, descriptions of what each column contains can be found in the [`summary_log()` docs](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/rbabylon/reference/summary_log.html).

```{r details columns}
sum_df %>% 
  collapse_to_string(estimation_method) %>%
  select(
    run,
    ofv, 
    param_count, 
    estimation_method, 
    problem_text, 
    number_of_patients, 
    number_of_obs, 
    condition_number
  )
```

## Run Heuristics Columns

The `run_heuristics` element of the `bbi_nonmem_summary` object contains a number of logical values indicating whether particular heuristic issues were found in the model. Note that these are not necessarily _errors_ with the model run, but are closer to warning flags that should possibly be investigated. Each heuristic is described in more detail in the [`summary_log()` docs](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/rbabylon/reference/summary_log.html). 

Note that **all heuristics will be `FALSE` by default (and _never_ `NA`) and will only be `TRUE` if they are explicitly triggered.** For example, `large_condition_number` will be `FALSE` even in the case when a condition number was not calculated at all.

All of the heuristic flags are pivoted out to their own columns in the `bbi_summary_log_df` tibble. It's useful to note that, except for `needed_fail_flags` (discussed above), these are the _only logical columns_ in the tibble and can therefore be easily selected with `tidyselect::where(is.logical)`. _(Note: `where()` only became available in `tidyselect (>= 1.1.0)`, released May 2020.)_

```{r heuristics columns fake where, eval=FALSE}
sum_df %>% select(run, where(is.logical), -needed_fail_flags)
```
```{r heuristics columns real where, echo=FALSE}
# tidyselect::where() was only added in May 2020 so, in order to avoid having to bump our "oldest supported"
# for the sake of vignette, we just do it the ugly way under-the-hood.
lgl_vars <- purrr::map_lgl(sum_df, is.logical)
sum_df %>% select(c("run", names(lgl_vars)[which(lgl_vars)]))
```

Notice that there is also an **any_heuristics column**, which can easily be used to filter to only runs that had at least one heuristic flag triggered.

# Add Summary

Just like [`config_log()` has `add_config()`](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/rbabylon/articles/using-based-on.html#checking-if-models-are-up-to-date-with-config_log), you can also use `add_summary()` to join all of these columns onto an existing `bbi_run_log_df` (the tibble output from `run_log()`). This can be useful if you have a run log that you have previously filtered on something like the [`tags`](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/rbabylon/articles/getting-started.html#filtering-tags-example) or [`based_on`](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/rbabylon/articles/using-based-on.html#filtering-tags-example) columns, and you would like to append some simple diagnostics.


```{r add summary}
# contrived example: in real life this would be filtering on tags, based_on, etc.
log_df <- run_log(MODEL_DIR)
log_df <- log_df[2:3, ]

# add summary columns
log_df <- log_df %>% add_summary()

log_df %>% select(run, tags, ofv, param_count, any_heuristics)
```
