\title{Read in model with error handling}
\usage{
safe_read_model(.path)
}
\arguments{
\item{.path}{Path to the model to read, in the sense of absolute model path.
The absolute model path is the path to the YAML file and model file, both
without extension, and (possibly) the output directory.}
}
\value{
A model object, if \code{.path} represents a valid model.
}
\description{
Private helper function that tries to call \code{\link[=read_model]{read_model()}} on a model path and
returns NULL, with no error, if the path is not a valid model file. Also
wraps \code{\link[=read_model]{read_model()}} in \code{suppressMessages()} so that things like the
\code{\link[=check_stan_model]{check_stan_model()}} messages will be suppressed. This is done because this
function is primarily used when mapping over a number of models and these
messages can be very annoying and mostly pointless in that context.
