\title{Private helper to build absolute path for \code{\link[=copy_model_from]{copy_model_from()}}.
Importantly, if the input \code{.new_model} is \emph{not} absolute, it will
be treated as relative to the working directory of \code{.parent_mod}.}
\usage{
build_new_model_path(.parent_mod, .new_model)
}
\arguments{
\item{.parent_mod}{Model to copy from}

\item{.new_model}{Path to the new model, either absolute or relative to the
path to \code{.parent_mod}. Represents an absolute model path, which is the path
to the YAML file and model file, both without extension, and the output
directory (once the model is run). Numeric values will be coerced to
character. If \code{NULL}, the default, will try to increment to the next integer
in the destination directory. See examples for usage.}
}
\value{
absolute file path to save new model to (without file extension)
