get_based_on(.bbi_object, .check_exists = FALSE)

\method{get_based_on}{default}(.bbi_object, .check_exists = FALSE)

\method{get_based_on}{character}(.bbi_object, .check_exists = FALSE)

\method{get_model_ancestry}{bbi_run_log_df}(.bbi_object)
}
\arguments{
\item{.bbi_object}{The model object to query. Could be
a \verb{bbi_\{.model_type\}_model} object,
a  file path to a model,
a tibble of class \code{bbi_run_log_df},
or some other custom object containing model data.}

\item{.check_exists}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, function will return all paths in \code{based_on} regardless of whether they point to an existing file.
If \code{TRUE}, function will check if a file exists at each path in \code{based_on} and error if one does not.}
}
\description{
Returns character vector (or list of character vectors) of the absolute paths to all models stored in the \code{based_on} field of a \code{bbi_...} object.
}
\details{
\code{get_model_ancestry()} extracts paths to all models that this model is based on (iterating over \code{get_based_on()} function),
and all models that those models are based on, recursively.
It returns a sorted unique character vector for the \code{default} and \code{character} method, and a list of such vectors for the \code{bbi_run_log_df} method.
Some notes on \code{get_model_ancestry()}:
\itemize{
\item \code{.check_exists = TRUE} is set for this iterative search because each model found will subsequently be loaded.
\item \code{get_model_ancestry()} has all the same S3 methods as \code{get_based_on()}
}

For both \code{get_based_on()} and \code{get_model_ancestry()}, all paths saved in the object or accompanying YAML will be relative \strong{to the location of that YAML}
When the object is loaded into memory, the absolute path to the YAML is stored in the object.
These functions simply stitch together that path with the relative paths from the \code{based_on} field.
As long as the YAML has not moved since it was read into memory, these paths will be both absolute and correct.

\section{Methods (by class)}{
\itemize{
\item \code{get_based_on(default)}: The default method attempts to extract the path from any object passed to it,
but is designed for a list of class \verb{bbi_\{.model_type\}_model} or something similar.

\item \code{get_based_on(character)}: Takes a character scalar of a path to a model that can be loaded with \code{read_model(.bbi_object)}.

\item \code{get_based_on(bbi_run_log_df)}: Takes a tibble of class \code{bbi_run_log_df} and returns a list containing one character vector of paths for each row of the tibble.
