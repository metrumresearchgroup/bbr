\usage{
use_bbi(.path = NULL, .version = "latest", .force = FALSE, .quiet = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{.path}{absolute path to install bbi to. See Details section for
defaults, if nothing is passed.}

\item{.version}{version of bbi to install. Must pass a character scalar
corresponding to a tag found in
\verb{https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/bbi/releases}}

\item{.force}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, skips installation if requested
version and local version are the same. If \code{TRUE} forces installation if it
will be the same version.}

\item{.quiet}{\strong{Deprecated.} Use \code{options("bbr.verbose")} instead to control
printing. Defaults to \code{NULL}, which reads \code{!getOption("bbr.verbose")}. If
\code{TRUE}, suppresses output printed to the console.}

\description{
Identifies system running and pulls the relevant tarball for the
current release of bbi from GitHub, and then installs it in the directory
passed to \code{.dir}. If used in an interactive session, will open an
installation menu confirming the installed version. This function will
print information about the installed version. This \strong{printing can be
suppressed} by setting \code{options(bbr.verbose = FALSE)}.
}
\details{
If nothing is passed to the \code{.path} argument, \code{use_bbi()} will
attempt to find a valid path for installation. The following decision
waterfall is used:
\itemize{
\item First, check \code{getOption("bbr.bbi_exe_path")}. If this is anything \emph{other
than} \code{"bbi"} (the default value) then attempt to install to that path.
\item Second, check \code{Sys.which("bbi")} which will look for a \code{bbi} installation
in the user's \verb{$PATH}. If one is found, ask the user if they wish to
overwrite it and, if they confirm, install to that path.
\item Third, attempt to install to a "default location" and add this location to
the user's \verb{$PATH}. If \code{Sys.getenv("XDG_DATA_HOME")} is found, install to
\code{{Sys.getenv("XDG_DATA_HOME")}/bbi/bbi} (per \href{https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html}{XGD specification}).
Otherwise, install to OS dependent defaults:
\itemize{
\item Linux: \code{{Sys.getenv("HOME")}/.local/share/bbi/bbi}
\item Mac: \verb{/usr/local/bin/bbi}
\item Windows: \verb{\{Sys.getenv("APPDATA")\}\\bbi\\bbi}
}
}

If none of these are successful, the user will be prompted to set
\code{options("bbr.bbi_exe_path")} and try again.
}
