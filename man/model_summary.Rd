\description{
Calls out to \code{bbi} and returns a named list of class
\verb{bbi_\{.model_type\}_summary} with model outputs and diagnostics. If user wants
to summarize multiple models, you can pass a list of
\verb{bbi_\{.model_type\}_model} objects to \code{\link[=model_summaries]{model_summaries()}}, or pass a directory
path to \code{\link[=summary_log]{summary_log()}} to summarize all models in that directory (and, by
default, all directories below it). Note: the summary object does \emph{not}
contain the covariance or correlation matrices, but these can be retrieved
with \code{\link[=cov_cor]{cov_cor()}}. Also, if you need to pull in \emph{only} the parameter estimates
for a large number of NONMEM models, consider using
\code{\link[=param_estimates_batch]{param_estimates_batch()}}.
}
\details{
\strong{NONMEM}

The returned list for a NONMEM model will contain the following top-level elements:
\itemize{
\item \strong{absolute_model_path} -- Absolute path to the model that generated this summary.
Note, using this directly is discouraged in favor of using the "getters"
described in the \code{\link{get_path_from_object}} help page.
\item \strong{run_details} -- General details about the run including estimation
method, numbers of subjects and records, significant digits, run time, and
more.
\item \strong{run_heuristics} -- Boolean flags indicating potential issues with the
run. \code{TRUE} for a given element indicates that issue was detected. \code{FALSE}
can either mean it was not detected or it was not applicable for that run.
If any of these come up \code{TRUE} it is best to investigate the issue, likely
by checking the \code{.lst} file. This can be done easily with
\code{\link[=build_path_from_model]{build_path_from_model()}} like \code{build_path_from_model(.mod, ".lst")}. See
below for details on each heuristic.
\itemize{
\item \code{covariance_step_aborted} -- It is possible for the Estimation Step to
terminate successfully, but have the Covariance Step generate an error
message. In general, successful completion of the Covariance Step
requires a better defined minimum than does the successful completion of
the Estimation Step. It is not necessarily an error but a warning, often
due to the model being overparameterized. Look at the variance
components of your model parameters (look for very small values e.g.
10^-6) and consider removing some of them to simplify the model.
\item \code{large_condition_number} -- \code{TRUE} if \code{condition_number > 1000}. Could
indicate highly correlated parameters, overparameterization, or other
issues. The condition number is the ratio of the largest eigenvalue to
the smallest eigenvalue. If there is only one eigenvalue, condition
number will be \code{1.0}.
\item \code{correlations_not_ok} -- Not currently implemented in \code{bbi}; will always
be \code{FALSE}.
\item \code{parameter_near_boundary} -- At least one scaled parameter estimate is
near the boundary of what was specified. This message indicates that one
of your parameters is either too small or too large, which sometimes may
be dealt with by changing your initial estimates. The boundary test is
user-selectable.
\item \code{hessian_reset} -- Indicates some problem during the search,
specifically that the approximation to the Hessian is no longer
acceptable, and must be “recomputed”. User should check the \code{.lst} file
to see how many resets occur and on which iterations. This message can
be safely ignored \emph{unless} more than just a couple of resets occur, or
if resets occur right before the end of the search. In these cases a
poor fit (judged by other means) can result and the user should
carefully regard their setup and consider possible reasons why a
minimum--let alone one which corresponds to a good estimate--was
difficult to find. There could be many possible reasons. The appearance
of the message can also explain why an unusually large number of
function evaluations were used for the iteration (extra ones were needed
to compute the new Hessian and perform a line search along the new
direction) and why an unusually long CPU time was needed for the
iteration (if intermediate output is being monitored). Its appearance
suggests that the search is not going easily, and perhaps (thought not
necessarily) that something is wrong with the model specification.
\item \code{has_final_zero_gradient} -- Could indicate a coding error, or that
there is not enough information for NONMEM to estimate the parameter.
Use \code{\link[=check_grd]{check_grd()}} to see which parameters are having issues. A gradient
of 0 at the start of the search indicates that there is a lack of
information for NONMEM to use in order to determine the best estimate
for that parameter. Zero gradient at the beginning of the iteration
process could indicate lack of information for that parameter (e.g.
adding gender effect and having a dataset with only males). The EM
algorithms report if a gradient for one of the THETAs is zero,
indicating improper model specification or coding.
\item \code{minimization_terminated} -- The minimization was terminated. This may also
involve considering posteriori non-identifiability because the data does not
really let you estimate some parameter, for example between subject
variability. In this case, consider simplifying the \emph{between subject variability} model.
If minimization was terminated due to rounding errors (\code{error=134}) this
message indicates that a sufficient number of digits were lost during
estimation resulting in termination of the optimization. One solution could
be to rerun the model with a new set of initial estimates and changing
\code{SIGDIGITS} to a higher number. Also consider if the model is
overparameterized.
\item \code{eta_pval_significant} -- \code{TRUE} if any of the ETA p-values are < 0.05
(extracted from \verb{$shrinkage_details$pval}). This indicates large
deviations from zero, which violates the assumption that ETA has a mean of
zero with a variance of OMEGA. This could be the consequence of asymmetric
shrinkage or a misfit model.
\item \code{prderr} -- \code{TRUE} if a \code{PRDERR} file is present in the output folder.
This indicates that NONMEM is unable to compute a prediction for a given
data record with the current THETA and ETA values.
}
\item \strong{parameters_data} -- Data about parameter estimates. This can be
accessed directly, but is much easier to look at with the
\code{\link[=param_estimates]{param_estimates()}} function (which parses this, and other related elements,
into a tibble).
\item \strong{parameter_names} -- Names of parameters (\code{THETA1}, \code{THETA2}, etc.).
Parsed into tibble by \code{\link[=param_estimates]{param_estimates()}}.
\item \strong{ofv} -- Objective function value, with and without constant. List with
one element for each estimation method.
\item \strong{condition_number} -- Condition number, if eigenvalues were returned
from NONMEM. List with one element for each estimation method.
\item \strong{shrinkage_details} -- Information about shrinkage. The shrinkage values
(using SD parameterization) are parsed into the tibble output from
\code{\link[=param_estimates]{param_estimates()}}. List of lists with one element for each estimation
method, and one element per sub-population within that.
}

The summary call will error if it does not find certain files in the output folder.
However, you can override this behavior with the following file-specific flags:
\itemize{
\item \code{no_ext_file}
\item \code{no_grd_file}
\item \code{no_shk_file}
}

If you are using an estimation method that does not produce any of the following files,
or they are missing for some other legitimate reason, pass the appropriate flags through the \code{.bbi_args} argument.
For example, if have asked to skip the \verb{$COV} step, you would call \code{model_summary(..., .bbi_args = list(no_cov_file = TRUE))}.

Additionally, if you have renamed the \code{.ext} file from its default of \verb{<root>.ext} you will need to pass
\code{ext_file = "NEWNAME"} to \code{.bbi_args}.
