\usage{
model_diff(.mod, .mod2 = NULL, .file = "model", ..., .viewer = FALSE)

\method{model_diff}{bbi_nonmem_model}(.mod, .mod2 = NULL, .file = c("model"), ..., .viewer = FALSE)

  .mod,
  .mod2 = NULL,
  .file = c("model", "standata", "init", "stanargs"),
  ...,
  .viewer = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.mod}{The \verb{bbi_\{.model_type\}_model} to compare.}

\item{.mod2}{If a \verb{bbi_\{.model_type\}_model} object is passed, compare \code{.mod} to
\code{.mod2}. If \code{.mod2 = NULL}, the default, compare \code{.mod} to the model at
\code{get_based_on(.mod)}. See "\code{based_on} details" in Details section.}

\item{.file}{Defaults to \code{"model"} which compares the default model file for
that model type. Some model types have multiple files that can be compared.
See "\code{.file} argument" in Details section.}

\item{...}{arguments passed through to methods. (Currently none.)}

\item{.viewer}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, prints diff to console or renders in
Rmd. If \code{TRUE}, render the diff in the Viewer window. Note: this option
will hold the console with \verb{Press ENTER to continue...} so it is only
recommended for interactive use.}
}
\value{
Returns a \code{"Diff"} object from the \code{diffobj} package that renders
when printed or called in the console.
}
\description{
By default, this compares a model's model file on disk to the model file of
its "parent" model (the model referenced in its \code{based_on} field).  It can
optionally take a second model (passed to \code{.mod2}), in which case it
will compare the first model to the second model, ignoring the \code{based_on}
field entirely.
}
\details{
\strong{Printing vs. knitting:} When using this function in an \code{.Rmd} file that
you intend to knit to HTML, be sure to \strong{set the chunk option \code{results = "asis"}} for the relevant chunk. If you do this, the \code{model_diff()} output
will render nicely in color in the HTML doc. Note \strong{this only works for HTML
output.} If you are are rendering to a different format (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
you can still use \code{model_diff()} \emph{without} \code{results = "asis"} and it will
render, although it won't look particularly nice.

\strong{\code{based_on} details:} As described above, if \code{.mod2} is \code{NULL} (the default),
then the \code{.mod} will be compared to the model returned by \code{get_based_on(.mod)}.
However, \emph{if there is more than one model} (or no models) in \code{.mod$based_on}, then user
will be prompted to explicitly pass the model they want to compare against to
the \code{.mod2} argument.

\strong{\code{.file} argument:} The following options are available for \code{.file}
\itemize{
\item \code{bbi_nonmem_model}
\itemize{
\item \code{"model"} compares the control streams
}
\item \code{bbi_stan_model}
\itemize{
\item \code{"model"} (default) compares \verb{<run>.stan} files
\item \code{"standata"} compares \verb{<run>-standata.R} files
\item \code{"init"} compares \verb{<run>-init.R} files
\item \code{"stanargs"} compares \verb{<run>-stanargs.R} files
}
}
