#' @section Join column:
#'
#' The `.join_col` is the name of a single column that should appear in both the
#' input data set and any tables you want to join. We recommend you make this
#' column a simple integer numbering the rows in the input data set (for example
#' `NUM`). When this column is carried into the output table files, there will
#' be unambiguous matching from the table file back to the input data set.
