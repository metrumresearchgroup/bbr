`bbr` helps manage the entire modeling workflow from within R. Users can submit models, inspect output and diagnostics, and iterate on models. Furthermore, workflow tools---such as simple tagging of models and model inheritance trees---make reproducibility and external review more streamlined.

`bbr` supports running NONMEM models via the [bbi](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/bbi) command-line tool, with a focus on non-Bayesian methods. The [bbr.bayes](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/bbr.bayes) package extends `bbr` to enable Bayesian estimation through either NONMEM or [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/).

## Installation

You can install the latest released version of `bbr` via [MPN snapshots](https://mpn.metworx.com/docs/snapshots) from any snapshot date in 2021 or later. (An earlier version of this package was available under the name `rbabylon` in snapshot dates 2020-03-07 through 2020-12-21.)

You can also install development versions of `bbr` by downloading the source files for the latest version from `https://s3.amazonaws.com/mpn.metworx.dev/releases/bbr/` or get the latest development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("metrumresearchgroup/bbr", ref = "main")
```
## Documentation

You can find documentation and a "Getting Started" vignette that shows users how to set up `bbr` and demonstrates the basic modeling workflow [here](http://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/bbr/).

There are several other vignettes, and more are being added as new functionality is rolled out. A complete list can be found [here](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/bbr/articles/).

### Featured Vignettes

* [Getting Started with bbr](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/bbr/articles/getting-started.html) -- Some basic scenarios for modeling with NONMEM using `bbr`, introducing you to its standard workflow and functionality.
* [Using the based_on field](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/bbr/articles/using-based-on.html) -- How to use the `based_on` field to track a model's ancestry through the model development process, as well how to leverage `config_log()` to check whether older models are still up-to-date.
* [Creating a Model Summary Log](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/bbr/articles/using-summary-log.html) -- How to use `summary_log()` to extract model diagnostics like the objective function value, condition number, and parameter counts.

## Development

`bbr` uses [pkgr](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/pkgr) to manage 
development dependencies and [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) to provide 
isolation. To replicate this environment, 

1. clone the repo

2. install pkgr

3. open package in an R session and run `renv::init(bare = TRUE)`
   - install `renv` > 0.8.3-4 into default `.libPaths()` if not already installed

3. run `pkgr install` in terminal within package directory

4. restart session

Then, launch R with the repo as the working directory (open the project in 
RStudio). renv will activate and find the project library.
